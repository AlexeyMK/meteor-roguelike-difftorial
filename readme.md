Note we're using the [underscore (_)](http://str8.to/underscore-js) library here, commonly used to get nice helper functions like range and filter.

Type
> meteor add underscore

to get access to the library.  Adding external libraries with Meteor is pretty easy. Type
> meteor list

to see available libraries.  (For the curious, there are more available via [meteorite](http://str8.to/meteor-meteorite).
