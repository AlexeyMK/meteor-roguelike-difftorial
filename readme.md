This is the "Build simple multiplayer games with Meteor" tutorial.

Welcome


**Assumptions:

- You've written at least some Javascript before. If not, head over somewhere like [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com).
- Some (though not a lot) familiarity with web development. PHP or Django or Rails or Express, the equivalent.  Meteor is a pretty great "my first web framework" type-tool, but this tutorial isn't optimizaed for that.  Be warned.
- You're using some flavor of Linux or OSX. It doesn't freak you out when I say "run X [on the command line]."
- Editor of choice (Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Notepadd++ - it doesn't matter, just have one).

**Let's get started.
- Go to [Meteor.com](http://meteor.com/) and install Meteor.
- In your working directory, type "meteor create roguelike_app"
